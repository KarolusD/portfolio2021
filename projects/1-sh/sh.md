title: Super heroes fights
role: Frontend developer & UX/UI designer
description: 'As far as I remember I was a fun of super heroes movies, especially from marvel and dc world. There was always an old-age question which hero is better and how the fight could end up if two heroes face up against each other. From that question the idea was born... I created a platform where you can easily test your favourite heroes in a fight. The fight itself is based on heroes power stats, preparation and some randomness which reiles on 3d dice roll.'
